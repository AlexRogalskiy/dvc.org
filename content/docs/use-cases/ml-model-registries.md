# Machine Learning Model Registries

General [data registries] optimize storage of and enhance reusability for raw
data and processed features as sources for multiple data science projects.
However there's a case for dedicated **model registries** which can be placed
further down the line -- as interfaces between mature projects and their
deployment for real-world applications. And since they're more specialized, they
require extended capabilities, which we'll discuss here.
