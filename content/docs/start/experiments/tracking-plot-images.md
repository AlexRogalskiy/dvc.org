### Using plots generated by scripts

Let's produce another plot to see misclassified examples from each class. This
procedure generates the misclassification examples from the validation data and
arranges them into a _confusion table_ that shows the correct label, and
misclassification sample. The code to generate an image from a set of training
images is omitted here but you can find the code in [the example
project.][misclassified-example-code]

DVC automatically shows the image in an HTML page with the command:

```dvc
$ dvc plots show plots/confusion.png
```
